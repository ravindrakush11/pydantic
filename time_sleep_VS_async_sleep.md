The difference between `time.sleep()` and `asyncio.sleep()` lies in **how they block execution** and the type of code they are used in ‚Äî **synchronous vs. asynchronous**.

---

### ‚úÖ **1. `time.sleep(seconds)`**

* Belongs to the standard `time` module.
* **Blocks the entire thread** during the sleep time.
* Used in **synchronous** code.

#### ‚ùå What happens:

```python
import time

print("Start")
time.sleep(2)  # Halts the entire thread for 2 seconds
print("End")
```

During the sleep, **nothing else can run** ‚Äî not even other functions or I/O.

---

### ‚úÖ **2. `asyncio.sleep(seconds)`**

* Comes from the `asyncio` module.
* **Non-blocking**: It suspends the current coroutine, allowing the event loop to continue running other coroutines.
* Used in **asynchronous** (`async def`) functions.

#### ‚úÖ What happens:

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    print("Start")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Doesn't block the event loop
    print("End")

asyncio.run(main())
```

Here, while `main()` is sleeping, the event loop can continue running **other tasks** concurrently.

| Feature            | `time.sleep()`                | `asyncio.sleep()`                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Type               | Blocking                      | Non-blocking                       |
| Used in            | Synchronous code              | Asynchronous code (`async def`)    |
| Freezes event loop | Yes                           | No                                 |
| Useful for         | Simple scripts, thread delays | Async tasks, I/O-bound concurrency |

---

### üß† Pro Tip:

Never use `time.sleep()` inside an `async def` function ‚Äî it will **block the event loop**, defeating the purpose of asynchronous programming.
